WP Subpages Widget
===========

WP Subpages Widget is a simple plugin to allow for multiple instances to show child pages.

For people who use multiple template files for each of their site's pages, having the capability of using a widget, rather than hardcode subpages of a parent or child page.

While the WordPress 3.0 Menu System allows users to be able to create a menu system with child pages, this plugin works with the natural Page hierarchy. It's great for sections of the website that have sub pages like alphabetical pages, and more.
